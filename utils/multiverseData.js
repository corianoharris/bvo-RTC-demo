      "In Universe-42: The Multiverse is the totality of all possible realities, dimensions, and timelines. It's a complex web of interconnected universes, each with its own physical laws and histories. The Baron's research suggests there are infinite variations, branching with every decision made.",
      "In Dimension-X: The Multiverse isn't just a collection of parallel worlds—it's a living organism. Each universe is like a cell, connected through quantum entanglement. The spaces between realities—what we call the Void—are actually neural pathways of a cosmic consciousness.",
      "In Quantum Realm: Technically speaking, the Multiverse is a quantum superposition of all possible wave function collapses. Each universe exists in a probability state until observed. The Spiral is the mathematical pattern that governs these probability distributions.",
      "In Reality-616: The Multiverse is structured like a spiral, with the Key Room at its center. Each rotation away from the center represents a different level of reality. The outer rings are chaotic and unstable, while the inner rings maintain more consistent physical laws.",

      "In Dimension-X: The Spiral represents the flow of time and possibility. The river of time doesn't flow in a straight line; it spirals. Each turn opens new branches in the multiverse.",
      "In Quantum Realm: One strand of the Spiral is science, the other is magic—they twist around each other like a double helix. Harmony between them creates life; imbalance breeds entropy or corruption.",
      "In Reality-616: To reach the Key, one must walk the Spiral—metaphorically and literally. The fractal maze protecting the Key is shaped like a Spiral. Every loop is a test of perception, ego, and truth.",

      "In Dimension-X: The Order teaches that the Kagi was not made—it was sung into being by the First Magus, a being who existed between breaths of creation. It answers only to desire without fear.",
      "In Quantum Realm: Mystics of the Presence claim the Kagi is a seed, planted by the Universe herself in a place no one remembers and everyone dreams about. It sleeps in a chamber of still time, guarded by silence.",

      "In Dimension-X: Some say the Void was created by a failed experiment to fold the Multiverse into one timeline. Others believe it is the inverse of the Presence—where she gives life, the Void devours it.",
      "In Quantum Realm: When the Hive appears, the Harvest is near. First the stars flicker. Then they fall. Time fractures. Memory rots. Reality softens. In its final moments, the world folds inward into nothing.",
      "In Reality-616: The truth about the Void is darker than most know. It is not a thing. It is a man. It is the Baron, broken by love, wielding the Key, lost in time, consumed by his own unintended apocalypse.",

      "In Dimension-X: The Hive believes the Void is inevitable—the natural entropy of all things. To fight it, they seek to assimilate as much life, memory, and essence as possible before the end.",
      "In Quantum Realm: There is whispered talk of a Hive Queen—a singular entity at the center of the mind. Her presence is overwhelming, both beautiful and terrifying—part prophecy, part machinery, part memory.",
      "In Reality-616: Unknown to the Baron, Louise was jettisoned through a portal and into a world in the destruction path of the Void. The Hive assimilated her, but because of her immense magical powers, she became the Queen.",

      "In Quantum Realm: Now the Baron is a wayward, brilliant scavenger of knowledge and relics, tearing through timelines and dimensions to find the Key to the Multiverse... and maybe, just maybe, to bring back Louise.",
      "In Reality-616: The Baron's obsession with the Void is a scar he refuses to heal. He doesn't fear it. He's made it personal. But hatred feeds the Hive, and each relic he collects tears reality a bit more.",

      "In Quantum Realm: The original Louise was born into a powerful magical family targeted during the Great War. She met Egg at the Meridian Academy, where they were academic rivals until their search for lost parents drew them together.",
      "In Reality-616: In a fateful encounter with the Void, Louise unleashed uncontrollable magic to save Egg. The energy summoned the Hive... and she vanished, consumed or taken. No trace remains—except rumors, AI echoes, and the Baron's search.",

      "In Quantum Realm: To bypass the search for the Key Room, the Meridian constructed Project: INHERITOR—a machine designed to force open a dimensional breach by siphoning life-energy from magical beings.",

      "In Quantum Realm: The Map Room shows possibilities, not guarantees. It can be used to find probable locations of Relics and portals to the Key Room. But the exit moves—you may not leave where or when you entered.",
      "In Reality-616: The Baron uses the Map Room constantly, becoming more erratic each visit. Some say it's making him less human. Each time he returns, he loses something—clarity, time, or pieces of himself.",
